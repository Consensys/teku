## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have discovered a security issue in Teku, we'd love to hear from you. We will take
all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable
amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

To report a security bug, email a description of the flaw and any related information
(e.g. reproduction steps, version) to  [security-quorum@consensys.net](mailto:security-quorum@consensys.net).

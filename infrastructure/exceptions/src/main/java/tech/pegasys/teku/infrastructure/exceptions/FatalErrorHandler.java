/**
 * Detects fatal errors ({@link OutOfMemoryError}) and shuts the process down.
 *
 * <p>Once the heap is exhausted the node cannot be trusted to make progress, so the only safe
 * option is to exit and let the process supervisor restart us. That only works if we actually
 * notice the error, which is harder than it looks:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The error is almost never seen in its original form. Anything thrown inside an async task
 *       arrives wrapped in a {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionException} (possibly several
 *       layers deep), or as a suppressed error of a combined future's failure, so {@code instanceof
 *       OutOfMemoryError} checks miss it. {@link #isFatalError} walks the whole cause/suppressed
 *       graph instead.
 *   <li>Most of the code base converts any {@link Throwable} into a failed future or a log line and
 *       carries on. {@link #shutdownIfFatalError(Throwable, String)} is called from those choke
 *       points so a swallowed error still terminates the node.
 *   <li>A graceful {@link System#exit(int)} runs shutdown hooks which stop services and wait on
 *       futures. Under memory pressure that can block forever, leaving a process that is alive but
 *       useless. We therefore always arm a watchdog which {@link Runtime#halt(int)}s if the
 *       graceful shutdown doesn't complete in time.
 * </ul>

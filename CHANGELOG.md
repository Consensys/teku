# Changelog

## Upcoming Breaking Changes
- Teku currently publishes a `head` event on the REST API 4 seconds into a slot even if a block has not been received. In a future release this will be changed so `head` event is only published when a new
  chain head block is imported. The `--Xvalidators-dependent-root-enabled` option can be used to switch to the new behaviour now for testing.
  Note: this should be applied to both the beacon node and validator client if running separately.
- The `/teku/v1/beacon/states/:state_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the standard API `/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id` which now returns the state as SSZ when the `Accept: application/octet-stream` header is specified on the request.

## Unreleased Changes

### Breaking Changes
- Binary downloads have been transitioned from Bintray to Cloudsmith.  Please ensure you use links in the documentation or release notes.
  Ansible users should ensure they have the latest version of the ansible role.
- Removed support for the no longer active Medalla and Toledo test networks.
  
### Additions and Improvements
- Optimised fork choice to avoid unnecessary copying, reducing CPU and memory usage.
- Added a labelled counter to metrics to display teku version, under `beacon_teku_version`. On startup the version being run will report as the label name, with a value of '1'.

### Bug Fixes
- Reduced verbosity of warning message when SIGHUP can't be intercepted (e.g. on Windows)
- Fixed build failure when checked out as a shallow clone. Shallow clones are still not recommended as the version number cannot be determined correctly.
- Logs generated during voluntary exit command processing should no longer contain usernames or passwords.
- Fixed case where sync could stall when switching to a new target chain that is shorter than the previous target.

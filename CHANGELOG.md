## Unreleased Changes

### Breaking Changes

### Additions and Improvements

- Added a hidden flag `--Xfork-choice-updated-always-send-payload-attributes` which would cause
payload attributes to be calculated and sent with every fcU. This could be useful for builders
consuming the `payload_attributes` SSE events.
- Added Deneb (aka Dencun) configuration for Sepolia network for epoch 132608 (2024-01-30 22:51:12 UTC).
- Added Deneb (aka Dencun) configuration for Holesky network for epoch 29696 (2024-02-07 11:34:24 UTC).
- Generate key at `â€”p2p-private-key-file` path if specified file doesn't exist.

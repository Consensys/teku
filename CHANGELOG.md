# Changelog

## Upcoming Breaking Changes
- The `/teku/v1/beacon/states/:state_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the standard API `/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id` which now returns the state as SSZ when the `Accept: application/octet-stream` header is specified on the request.
- The `/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint `/eth/v2/debug/beacon/states/:state_id`
- The `/eth/v1/beacon/blocks/:block_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint `/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/:block_id`
- The `/eth/v1/validator/blocks/:slot` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint `/eth/v2/validator/blocks/:slot`
- The `-jdk14` and `-jdk15` docker image variants will be removed in a future release. JDK 14 and 15 are no longer receiving security updates from upstream vendors.
  Note that the default docker image usage JDK 16 and is still receiving security updates.
- The commandline option `--validators-performance-tracking-enabled` has been deprecated in favour of `--validators-performance-tracking-mode`

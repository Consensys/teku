# Changelog

## Upcoming Breaking Changes
- Docker images will default to the JDK 17 variant in a future release.
- The `/teku/v1/beacon/states/:state_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the standard API `/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id` which now returns the state as SSZ when the `Accept: application/octet-stream` header is specified on the request.
- The `/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint `/eth/v2/debug/beacon/states/:state_id`
- The `/eth/v1/beacon/blocks/:block_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint `/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/:block_id`
- The `/eth/v1/validator/blocks/:slot` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint `/eth/v2/validator/blocks/:slot`
- The commandline option `--validators-performance-tracking-enabled` has been deprecated in favour of `--validators-performance-tracking-mode`
- The commandline option `--network` of the `validator-client` subcommand introduces a new option value `auto`, which automatically 
fetches network configuration information from the configured beacon node endpoint. Other `--network` option values for an external validator client 
 are now deprecated in favour of this option value (usage: `teku validator-client --network=auto`)

- The command argument `--Xengine-exchange-capabilities` will be removed, update to use `--engine-exchange-capabilities` if you are using this option.

### Additions and Improvements
 - Set `User-Agent` header to "teku/v<version>" (e.g. teku/v23.4.0) when making builder bid requests to help builders identify clients and versions. Use `--builder-set-user-agent-header=false` to disable. 
 - Included more context when a request to an external signer fails.
 - Added `/eth/v1/beacon/rewards/blocks/{block_id}` rest api endpoint.

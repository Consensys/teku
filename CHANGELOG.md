## Upcoming Breaking Changes
- Teku currently publishes a `head` event on the REST API 4 seconds into a slot even if a block has not been received. In a future release this will be changed so `head` event is only published when a new
  chain head block is imported. The `--Xvalidators-dependent-root-enabled` option can be used to switch to the new behaviour now for testing.
  Note: this should be applied to both the beacon node and validator client if running separately.
- The `/teku/v1/beacon/states/:state_id` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the standard API `/eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id` which now returns the state as SSZ when the `Accept: application/octet-stream` header is specified on the request.

## Unreleased Changes

### Breaking Changes
- Binary downloads have been transitioned from Bintray to Cloudsmith.  Please ensure you use links in the documentation or release notes.

### Additions and Improvements
- Optimised fork choice to avoid unnecessary copying, reducing CPU and memory usage.

### Bug Fixes
- Reduced verbosity of warning message when SIGHUP can't be interecepted (e.g. on Windows)
- Fixed build failure when checked out as a shallow clone. Shallow clones are still not recommended as the version number cannot be determined correctly.

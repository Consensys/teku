# Changelog

Due to the rapidly changing nature of ETH2 testnets and rapid rate of improvements to Teku, 
we recommend most users use the latest `master` branch of Teku.

## Upcoming Breaking Changes

- In a future release the `--eth1-enabled` option will be removed. 
  ETH1 will be enabled when an `--eth1-endpoint` is provided and otherwise disabled.
- CLI option `--validators-key-file` renamed to `--validators-unencrypted-key-file` to avoid ambiguity from similar 
named CLI option `--validators-key-files` which is used to specify encrypted validator keystore files.
- Added CLI option `--rest-api-host-whitelist` which restricts access to the REST API. Defaults to [localhost, 127.0.0.1]

## 0.11.2

### Additions and Improvements

- Updated to spec version v0.11.3.
- Improved recovery from network changes. Peers are now disconnected if they do not respond for a 
  period ensuring upstream network interruptions are detected and peers can reconnect.
- The node's ENR is printed at startup even if the genesis state is not yet known.
  As per the beacon chain spec, the network ports are still not opened until the genesis state is known.
- OpenAPI schemas are now more compatible with code generating tools.
- Include block root in `/beacon/block` responses.
- Improved error messages when invalid or incompatible CLI options are provided.
- Improved peer discovery by filtering out peers with incompatible `eth2` ENR fields.
- Improved performance of BLS signature verification
- Updated to jvm-libp2p 0.4.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a deadlock condition which could cause block imports to silently stall.
- Initial sync now reaches chain head correctly even when the chain has not finalized for more than 10 epochs.
- Fixed `NullPointerException` and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException` intermittently encountered when importing blocks 
  due to a concurrency issue in batch signature verification.
- `/beacon/chainhead` reported incorrect slot and block root data.
- Fixed a range of race conditions when loading chain data which could result in inconsistent views 
  of the data or data not being found as it moved from recent to finalized storage.
- Significantly reduced the number of ERROR level log messages. 
  Invalid network data or unexpectedly disconnected peers is now logged at DEBUG level.
- Storage system did not correctly prune blocks loaded from disk on startup when they became finalized.


### Known Issues

- This release provides support for the Witti testnet via `--network witti` however the configuration 
  for this testnet is not yet stable and will likely differ from the one currently used.
- The Schlesi testnet has been abandoned. The `--network schlesi` option will be removed in a future release.
- Memory usage grows signficantly during periods of non-finalization.
- Teku requires the ETH1 endpoint to keep historic world state available for at least the ETH1 voting period. 
  This is typically more historic state than is kept when ETH1 nodes are pruning state. 
  Workaround is to connect to an archive node or configure the node to preserve a greater period of historic world state.

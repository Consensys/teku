This parameter is only\nrelevant if the beacon node is connected to a builder, deems it safe to produce a builder\npayload, and receives valid responses from both the builder endpoint _and_ the paired\nexecution node. When these preconditions are met, the server MUST act as follows:\n\n* if `exec_node_payload_value >= builder_boost_factor * (builder_payload_value // 100)`,\n  then return a full (unblinded) block containing the execution node payload.\n* otherwise, return a blinded block containing the builder payload header.\n\nServers must support the following values of the boost factor which encode common\npreferences:\n\n* `builder_boost_factor=0`: prefer the execution node payload unless an error makes it\n  unviable.\n* `builder_boost_factor=100`: default profit maximization mode; choose whichever\n  payload pays more.\n* `builder_boost_factor=2**64 - 1`: prefer the builder payload unless an error or\n  beacon node health check makes it unviable.\n\nServers should use saturating arithmetic or another technique to ensure that large values of\nthe `builder_boost_factor` do not trigger overflows or errors. If this parameter is\nprovided and the beacon node is not configured with a builder then the beacon node MUST\nrespond with a full block, which the caller can choose to reject if it wishes. If this\nparameter is **not** provided then it should be treated as having the default value of 100.\nIf the value is provided but out of range for a 64-bit unsigned integer, then an error\nresponse with status code 400 MUST be returned.",

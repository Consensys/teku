The information supplied for each validator index is considered persistent until overwritten by new information for the given validator index, or until the beacon node restarts.\n\nNote that because the information is not persistent across beacon node restarts it is recommended that either the beacon node is monitored for restarts or this information is refreshed by resending this request periodically (for example, each epoch).\n\nAlso note that registrations for exited validators will be filtered out and not sent to the builder network. However, registrations for inactive or unknown validators will be sent, as they may become active at a later epoch.",

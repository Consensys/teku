This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as part of a distributed validator cluster, and is implemented by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is used to exchange partial selection proof slot signatures for combined/aggregated selection proofs to allow a validator client to correctly determine if one of its validators has been selected to perform a sync committee contribution (sync aggregation) duty in this slot. Consensus clients need not support this endpoint and may return a 501.",

## /node/genesis_time

In [eth2-api]("https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs") genesis_time should either return
* 200 code and a numeric
* 500 internal error

Any time a beacon node is in a pre-genesis state, it will be a valid condition to have no
genesis time set. For this reason, it was deemed more appropriate to return:
* 200 code and a numeric
* 204 (no content)

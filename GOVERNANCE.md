# Overview
This project is led by a benevolent dictator (Consensys) and managed by the community. The community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic direction is set by the benevolent dictator. In case of disagreement, the benevolent dictator has the final say. It is their responsibility to resolve disputes within the community and ensure the project progresses in a coordinated manner.

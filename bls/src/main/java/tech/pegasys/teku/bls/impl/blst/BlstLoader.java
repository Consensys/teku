/**
 * The BLST JNI clases use a static block to automatically load the native library. That means that
 * it loads as soon as the class is loaded which is hard to control. Since the native library may
 * not be supported on all platforms we need to control when the native library loads and handle any
 * exceptions from it by using a fallback instead.
 *
 * <p>So this class only refers to Blst classes via reflection to ensure just referencing this class
 * does not trigger those classes to load.

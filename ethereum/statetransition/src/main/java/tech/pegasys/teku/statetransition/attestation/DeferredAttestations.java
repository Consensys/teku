/**
 * Holds information about attestations received in the same slot they were created in which can't
 * be applied until the start of the next slot. Added attestations must have already been validated
 * as no further validation will be performed.
 *
 * <p>The aim is to store these in a memory efficient form since a lot of attestations are included
 * in this group but also make them fast to apply.
 *
 * <p>Generally there should only be attestations for one slot (the current slot) stored at a time,
 * however support for multiple slots is provided because at the start of the next slot, new
 * attestations may be received before the attestations from the prior slot have had a chance to be
 * removed and applied.

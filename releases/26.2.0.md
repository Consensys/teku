# Changelog

This is a recommended update containing improvements and bug fixes.

**Checkpoint syncing nodes:** This release includes a new data columns sidecar backfiller. If you experience high CPU usage affecting validator duty performances, you can:
- Reduce the backfill batch size (default: 3) by setting `--Xp2p-reworked-sidecar-custody-sync-batch-size=1`
- Make sure `--p2p-peer-upper-bound` is not set too high (default: 100)

**RocksDB migration:** The new default database system used by Teku is RocksDB.
Existing LevelDB databases will not migrate automatically to RocksDB.
To migrate from LevelDB to RocksDB, you need to stop your Teku service and delete both the `db` directory and `db.version` file from your beacon node data directory.
Upon restart, your node will recreate the database using RocksDB.
**Important:** Before migrating, ensure you have `--checkpoint-sync-url` or `--initial-state` configured. Without one of these, Teku will fail to start after the database is deleted, as it will have no way to reconstruct the beacon state.

### Breaking Changes
 - Removed development cli arg `--Xp2p-reworked-sidecar-recovery-enabled`.

### Additions and Improvements

- Using RocksDB as the default for new databases (previous databases using LevelDB will not be migrated automatically).
- New data columns sidecar backfiller enabled. It improves how the beacon node downloads past blobs related data it needs to custody.
- New CLI flag `--rest-api-getblobs-sidecars-download-enabled` allows the beacon node to serve `getBlobs` REST API responses by attempting to fetch missing blob sidecars from the p2p network. The new flag `--rest-api-getblobs-sidecars-download-timeout` controls the network fetch timeout (default: 5 seconds).
- New CLI flag `--force-clear-db` to remove the beacon database on startup.

### Bug Fixes

- Added `DOMAIN_BLS_TO_EXECUTION_CHANGE` to spec api output.

Implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain.

Based on the (evolving) [specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md).

## Build Instructions

To build, clone this repo and run with `gradle` like so:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis.git
$ cd artemis
$ ./gradlew
```

After a successful build, distribution packages will be available in `build/distributions`.

## Run Demo

After building, follow these instructions:

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ sh run.sh [NUMBER OF NODES]
```

> Note:  You will need tmux installed for this demo to work

## Code Style

We use Google's Java coding conventions for the project. To reformat code, run: 

```
$ ./gradlew spotlessApply
```

Code style will be checked automatically during a build.

## Testing

All the unit tests are run as part of the build, but can be explicitly triggered with:
```
$ ./gradlew test
```

## Run Options

```
$ ./gradlew run --args='-h'

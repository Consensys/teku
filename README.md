Implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain.

Based on the (evolving) [specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md).

> NOTE:  This repo is still in early development.

## Build Instructions

To build, clone this repo and run with `gradle` like so:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis.git
cd artemis
./gradlew
```

After a successful build, distribution packages will be available in `build/distributions`.

## Code Style

We use Google's Java coding conventions for the project. To reformat code, run: 

```
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

Code style will be checked automatically during a build.

## Testing

All the unit tests are run as part of the build, but can be explicitly triggered with:
```
./gradlew test
```
The integration tests can be triggered with:
```
./gradlew integrationTest
```

## Run Options

To view the run menu:

```
$ ./gradlew run --args='-h'

Usage: Artemis [-hpV]
  -h, --help                       Show this help message and exit.
  -p, --PoWChainServiceDisabled    If this option is enabled then the PoW Chain service is disabled.
  -V, --version                    Print version information and exit.
```

You can run the executable from the CLI with this command:
```
./gradlew run
```

To run without a PoW Chain:

```
$ ./gradlew run --args='-p'
```

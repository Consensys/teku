## Binary Releases

Binary releases are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/Consensys/teku/releases).
Binary builds that track the latest changes on the master branch are available on
[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/consensys/teku) using the `develop` version or as binary
downloads ([tar.gz format](https://artifacts.consensys.net/public/teku/raw/names/teku.tar.gz/versions/develop/teku-develop.tar.gz)
or [zip format](https://artifacts.consensys.net/public/teku/raw/names/teku.zip/versions/develop/teku-develop.zip)).

We recommend only using release versions for Mainnet, but `develop` builds are useful for testing
the latest changes on testnets.

## Build Instructions

### Install Prerequisites

* Java 21+

Note: Official builds of Teku are performed with Java 21.
Building on a more recent version of Java is supported, but the resulting build will not work on earlier versions of Java.


### Build and Dist

To create a ready to run distribution:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/Consensys/teku.git
cd teku && ./gradlew distTar installDist
```

This produces:
- Fully packaged distribution in `build/distributions` 
- Expanded distribution, ready to run in `build/install/teku`

### Build and Test

To build, clone this repo and run with `gradle`:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/Consensys/teku.git
cd teku && ./gradlew

```

After a successful build, distribution packages are available in `build/distributions`.

## Code Style

We use Google's Java coding conventions for the project. To reformat code, run:

```shell script
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

Code style is checked automatically during a build.

## Testing

All the unit tests are run as part of the build, but can be explicitly triggered with:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```

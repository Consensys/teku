# Generated REST API documentation sources

This directory contains base files to generate REST API doc with CI.

- index.html is the root file that will be copied to gh-pages
- TARGET_README.md is the readme that will be renamed and copied to the gh-pages branch
- README.md will not be copied, it's this file.
- .circleci directory contains a configuration for CircleCI that does nothing but prevents CI to fail.

The actual up to date generated doc is available at https://consensys.github.io/teku/

# The Beacon Chain - Phase 0

## Ethereum 2.0 Overview

![1]

## High-level Architectural Mental Model

![2]

The beacon chainâ€™s proposed architecture can be described using terminology similar to the Pantheon client:

- Attestations Pool: Manages pending attestations with peers.
- Synchronizer: Updates local blockchain based on peers.
- Block Processor: creates crosslinks, applies penalties and rewards.
- Blockchain: Manages blockchain constructs.
- Main Loop: Orchestrates interactions amongst components.
- JSON-RPC: Responsible for handling JSON-RPC messages.
- Logging, Configuration, CLI: Self-explanatory.
- P2P Communications
- Discovery - find peers/resources on the network
- Routing - what path (through peers) to take when communicating
- Transport - the communication protocol used
- Messaging - is transport agnostic and represents the way peers communicate at the application layer.  The current plan is to use GossipSub.

# Getting Started with Artemis

After you download and unpackage Artemis:
1. At the command line, change into the `artemis-<release>` directory. 

2. To display the command line help:
    ```json
    ./bin/artemis --help
   ```

A [basic quickstart](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis/wiki/Quickstart) and other options for [starting Artemis](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis/wiki/Starting-Artemis) are included in the documentation. 

The documentation is included in this release package and on the [Artemis Wiki](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis/wiki). 

>**Note** Starting Artemis by double-clicking the `artemis` or `artemis.bat` executables starts a node synchronizing with the Ethereum mainnet.

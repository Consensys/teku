Options:

        <ENDPOINT>...]...
                          Beacon Node REST API endpoint(s). If more than one
                            endpoint is defined, the first node will be used as
                            a primary and others as failovers.

      --Xsentry-config-file=<FILE>
                          Config file with sentry node configuration

First Mixin
      --value1=<value1>   Set a value with a really quite long description
                            given that it doesn't actually say anything. Some
                            people would think I'm just testing the wrapping
                            behaviour or something...
      --value2=<value2>   Set a second value

Actual Arg Group      --beacon-node-api-endpoint, --beacon-node-api-endpoints=<ENDPOINT>[,
        <ENDPOINT>...]...
                          Beacon Node REST API endpoint(s). If more than one
                            endpoint is defined, the first node will be used as
                            a primary and others as failovers.
